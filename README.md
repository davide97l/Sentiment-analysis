# Sentiment-analysis

Opinion mining (sometimes known as sentiment analysis or emotion AI) refers to the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study aﬀective states and subjective information. Sentiment analysis is widely applied to the voice of the customer materials such as reviews and survey responses, online and social media, and healthcare materials for applications that range from marketing to customer service to clinical medicine. Industrial circles utilize opinion mining techniques to detect people’s preference for further recommendation, such as movie reviews and restaurant reviews. In this assignment, we need to establish a sentiment classiﬁcation model for the given sentence.
