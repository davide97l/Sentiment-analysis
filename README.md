# Sentiment-analysis

Opinion mining (sometimes known as sentiment analysis or emotion AI) refers to the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study aﬀective states and subjective information. Sentiment analysis is widely applied to the voice of the customer materials such as reviews and survey responses, online and social media, and healthcare materials for applications that range from marketing to customer service to clinical medicine. Industrial circles utilize opinion mining techniques to detect people’s preference for further recommendation, such as movie reviews and restaurant reviews. In this assignment, we need to establish a sentiment classiﬁcation model for the given sentence.

## Dataset preparation
Each dataset should be formed by 3 files: `train.txt`, `dev.txt`, `test.txt`, each having the following structure. Make sure the 3 files are placed the same folder.
```
  l1 sentence1
  l2 sentence2
  ...
  lN sentenceN
```
You can find some examples in the directories `dataset/sst5` and `dataset/sst2` taken from Stanford Sentiment Treebank datasbase with 5 and 2 classes respectively.

## CNN (Convolutional network)

## RNN (LSTM)

## RNF (Recursive neural kernel)
